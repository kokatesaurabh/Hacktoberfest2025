# Data_Structures & Algorithms

This folder contains a few sample implementations of Merge Sort across multiple languages for practice and contribution.

Files added:

- `C/merge_sort.c` - Merge Sort in C. Compile with `gcc -O2 -o merge_sort merge_sort.c` and run `./merge_sort`.
- `Cpp/merge_sort.cpp` - Merge Sort in C++. Compile with `g++ -O2 -std=c++17 -o merge_sort merge_sort.cpp` and run `./merge_sort`.
- `Java/MergeSort.java` - Merge Sort in Java. Compile with `javac MergeSort.java` and run `java MergeSort`.
- `python/merge_sort.py` - Merge Sort in Python. Run with `python3 merge_sort.py`.
- `Javascript/merge_sort.js` - Merge Sort in Node.js. Run with `node merge_sort.js`.

These are small, self-contained examples intended to be easy to read and extend. Contributions welcome!
